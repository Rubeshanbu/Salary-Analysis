# Welcome to the Survey of Salary Analysis by Job Title repository! 
This project aims to provide insights into salary trends across different job titles using a dataset collected through surveys. The analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, and the findings are documented here.


## Introduction
In the modern job market, understanding salary distributions and trends for various job titles is crucial for both job seekers and employers. This repository presents an in-depth analysis of salary data collected through surveys from professionals across different industries and job roles.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from our proprietary survey, which garnered responses from thousands of individuals across diverse job titles. The dataset includes information such as job title, years of experience, educational background, location, and corresponding salary.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted primarily using Microsoft Excel. We performed data cleaning, preprocessing, and calculations to derive meaningful insights. The process involved filtering, sorting, aggregation, and visualization of the data to reveal patterns and trends related to salaries based on job titles.

## Analysis
Data Cleaning: The initial step involved cleaning the dataset to remove any inconsistencies or missing values that could affect the accuracy of the analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
We conducted exploratory analysis to gain a preliminary understanding of the dataset. This included generating summary statistics, distribution plots, and identifying outliers.

## Grouping by Job Title: 
The data was grouped by job title to calculate average, median, and range of salaries for each role.

## Experience and Education: 
We explored the relationship between years of experience, education level, and corresponding salaries.

## Results
Our analysis yielded several key findings:

1. Certain job titles exhibit significantly higher average salaries, reflecting their demand and importance within their respective industries.
2. Geographic location has a notable impact on salary, with positions in high-cost-of-living areas generally offering higher compensation.
3. Years of experience and education appear to be positively correlated with salary, indicating the value of skill and expertise.
